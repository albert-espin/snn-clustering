# Shared Nearest Neighbor Clustering Algorithm: Implementation and Evaluation

The Shared Nearest Neighbor clustering algorithm [1], also known as SNN, is an extension of DBSCAN that aims to overcome its limitation of not being able to correctly create clusters of different densities. This work provides a Python 3 implementation for SNN following the conventions of the scikit-learn library, and compares its results to multiple datasets with other, more traditional clustering methods.
